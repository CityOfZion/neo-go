# NEO-GO Compiler

The neo-go compiler compiles Go programs to bytecode that the NEO virtual machine can understand.

> The neo-go compiler is under very active development and will be updated on a weekly basis.

## Currently supported
- type checker
- multiple assigns
- types int, string and bool
- struct types + method receives
- functions

- return statements

## Not yet implemented
- for loops
- ranges
- builtins (append, len, ..)
- blockchain helpers (sha256, storage, ..)
- import packages

## How to report bugs
1. Make a proper testcase (example testcases can be found in the tests folder)
2. Create an issue on Github 
3. Make a PR with a reference to the created issue, containing the testcase that proves the bug
4. Either you fix the bug yourself or wait for patch that solves the problem
