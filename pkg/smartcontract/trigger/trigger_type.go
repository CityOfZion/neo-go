	// The verification trigger indicates that the contract is being invoked as a verification function.
	// The verification function can accept multiple parameters, and should return a boolean value that indicates the validity of the transaction or block.
	// The entry point of the contract will be invoked if the contract is triggered by Verification:
	//     main(...);

	// The application trigger indicates that the contract is being invoked as an application function.
	// The application function can accept multiple parameters, change the states of the blockchain, and return any type of value.
	// The contract can have any form of entry point, but we recommend that all contracts should have the following entry point:
	//     public byte[] main(string operation, params object[] args)
	// The functions can be invoked by creating an InvocationTransaction.
	Application Type = 0x40

	// All represents any trigger type.
