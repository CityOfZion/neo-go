// The algorithm for the unoptimsied version is simple:
// Download 2000 headers, then download the blocks for those headers
// Once those blocks are downloaded, we repeat the process again
// Until we are nomore than one block behind the tip.
// Once this happens, we switch into normal mode.
//In normal mode, we have a timer on for X seconds and ask nodes for blocks and also to doublecheck
// if we are behind once the timer runs out.
// The timer restarts whenever we receive a block.
// The parameter X should be approximately the time it takes the network to reach consensus

// a block in the network. Once a node has synchronised with the network, he will
// ask the network for a newblock every blockTimer
