/*
Package client implements NEO-specific JSON-RPC 2.0 client.
This package is currently in alpha and is subject to change.

Client

After creating a client instance with or without a ClientConfig
you can interact with the NEO blockchain by its exposed methods.

Some of the methods also allow to pass a verbose bool. This will
return a more pretty printed response from the server instead of
a raw hex string.

TODO:
	Add missing methods to client.
	Allow client to connect using client cert.
	More in-depth examples.
